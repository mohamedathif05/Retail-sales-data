Retail Sales Data – Price Trends Project Summary

In this project, I analyzed retail sales data to uncover pricing and sales trends. The work was divided into three main parts:

Data Preparation (Pandas):
I cleaned the dataset by removing missing values, duplicates, and canceled orders. I also created a new column TotalPrice (Quantity × UnitPrice) and exported the cleaned data for further use.

SQL Insights:
I loaded the cleaned data into a SQL database and extracted business insights including:

Top 10 customers by total spending

Total sales by country

The month with the highest sales

Average order value per customer

EDA & Visualization (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib):
I performed exploratory analysis and visualized key trends:

A time series line plot showing monthly sales trends

A bar chart of top countries by revenue

A pie chart of the top 5 customers' contribution

A heatmap showing sales by month and country

This project demonstrated my skills in data cleaning, SQL querying, and data visualization to derive meaningful business insights.
